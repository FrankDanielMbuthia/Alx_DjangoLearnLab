To begin, I know this is the repository used to do projects. I just want to make it clear I am not submiting prior projects, but I am specifically submitting the gym_management project in this repository. I used this repository just to bundle together my work.

**GYM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**

This is a Gym Management System built with Django.
It allows users to register, log in, and view their membership details such as their plan, join date, and expiry date.
The admin can manage members and membership plans through the Django admin panel.
The project also includes basic API endpoints built using Django REST Framework to demonstrate backend CRUD operations.
